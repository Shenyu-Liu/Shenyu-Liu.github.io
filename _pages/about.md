Welcome!
======
Welcome! I was born in China in 1990, stayed at my hometown for 18 years and then went to college overseas in 2008. In 2014 I obtained my bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics at National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore before I came to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), USA. I then received my master&rsquo;s degree in Mechanical Science and Engineering at UIUC in 2015 and PhD degree in Electrical Engineering at UIUC in 2020, under the supervision of <a href="http://liberzon.csl.illinois.edu/"> Prof. Daniel Liberzon</a> and <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/belabbas/"> Prof. Mohamed-Ali Belabbas</a>. Although I always want to do something on robotics, my research, however, is quite theoretical. Previously in UIUC when collaborating with Prof. Liberzon I was working on analyzing stability of nonlinear systems via non-monotonic Lyapunov function approach and (integral) input-to-state stability of switched nonlinear systems, and collaborating with Prof. Belabbas I was working on motion planning of nonlinear systems via geometrical control approach. After obtaining my PhD degree, I have been a postdoc researcher in University of California, San Diego (UCSD) till now (which was entirely during the breakout of COVID-19). During the time in UCSD, I am under the supervision of <a href="http://carmenere.ucsd.edu/jorge/">Prof. Jorge Cortes</a> and <a href="http://nodes.ucsd.edu/sonia/">Prof. Sonia Martinez</a> and my research is about network resiliance analysis and improving its robustness against adversaries by switching. Now I have returned China in 2022. I am going to join the school of automation at Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) as an assistant professor. My major research direction is on stability of nonlinear systems, modeling and control of hybrid systems, data-driven control and distributed control.

<p>Welcome! I am a 4th year PhD student in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), under the supervision of <a href="http://liberzon.csl.illinois.edu/">Prof. Daniel Liberzon</a> and <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/belabbas/">Prof. Mohamed-Ali Belabbas</a>. I was born in China in 1990, stayed at my hometown for 18 years and then went to college overseas in 2008. In 2014 I obtained my bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics at National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore before I came to UIUC. I then received my master&rsquo;s degree in Mechanical Science and Engineering at UIUC in 2015. Although I always want to do something on robotics, my research, however, is quite theoretical. Collaborating with Prof. Liberzon I am working on analyzing stability of nonlinear systems via non-monotonic Lyapunov function approach and (integral) input-to-state stability of switched nonlinear systems. Collaborating with Prof. Belabbas I am working on motion planning of nonlinear systems via geometrical control approach.</p>

<p>As a PhD candidate, I sometimes serve as a teaching assistant (TA) for my department. Classes I have been TA for including <a href="http://coecsl.ece.illinois.edu/me340/">ME340: Dynamics of Mechanical Systems</a>, <a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/profile/ECE470">ECE470: Introduction to Robotics</a>, <a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/profile/ECE486">ECE 486: Control Systems</a> and my favorite class ECE553: Optimum Control Systems. I have also been a volunteer for the <a href="https://allerton.csl.illinois.edu/">56th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control and Computing</a> in 2018 and I have been the Control and Decision session chair for the <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/cslstudentconference2019/">2019 CSL Student Conference.</a></p>
